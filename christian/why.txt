Am         Em      Am              C          Em       Am
Why did it have to be a friend who chose to betray the Lord
Am         Em    Am                        C          Em      Am
Why did he use a kiss to show them? That's not what a kiss is for
C                   G                Am                      E
Only a friend can betray a friend, a stranger has nothing to gain
Am         Em           Am              C          Em      Am
And only a friend comes close enough to ever cause so much pain
 
And why did there have to be thorny, crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one, made of jewels and gold instead
It had to be a crown of thorns, because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love, a thorn is all the world has to give
 
And why did it have to be  a heavy, cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands, when His love would have held Him there
It was a cross for on a cross, a thief was supposed to pay
And Jesus had come into the world, to steal every heart away
Yes, Jesus had come into the world to steal every heart away
