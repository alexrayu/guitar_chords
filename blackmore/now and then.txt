    C            G                 Dm               Am
The past is so familiar But that's why you couldn't stay
         F                C                
Too many ghosts, too many haunted dreams 
   Dm            F           G      G/H
Beside you were built to find your own way...
C               G              E7                      Am
  But after all these years, I thought we'd still hold on
           F                 C                  Dm                 G
But when I reach for you and search your eyes I see you've already gone...
       C          G               E7                 Am
That's OK I'll be fine I've got myself, I'll heal in time
             F             C             G    G/H
But when you leave just remember what we had...
                C              G         E7           E7/G#   Am
There's more to life than just you I may cry but I'll make it through
      F             C              | G G | 
And I know that the sun will shine again      
G
  Though I may think of you now and then...

C                     G         Dm                Am
Can't do a thing with ashes But throw them to the wind...
            F               C              Dm        F        G    G/H
Though this heart may be in pieces now You know I'll build it up again 
    C                 G              E7       Am
And   I'll come back stronger than I ever did before
           F               C                          G
Just don't turn around when you walk out that door...
       C          G               E7                 Am
That's OK I'll be fine I've got myself, I'll heal in time
             F             C             G    G/H
But when you leave just remember what we had...
                C              G         E7           E7/G#   Am
There's more to life than just you I may cry but I'll make it through
      F             C               G                                      
And I know that the sun will shine again 
                                  | C G |
Though I may think of you now and then...
        C          G               E7                 Am
That's OK I'll be fine I've got myself, I'll heal in time
    F               C              G
And even though our stories at the end 
                                 C
I still may think of you now and then...
