Dm                  C    Am   Dm        C     A       Dm
Past time with good company I love, and shall until I die

Grutch who lust, but none deny So God be pleased, thus live will I
    Dm C   F          Dm   C   F        C        Am 
For my pastance Hunt, sing and dance My heart is set;
    Dm  C  F         Dm C  F        C     A  Dm    | Dm | 
All goodly sport For my comfort Who shall me let?
Dm                   C      Am    Dm      C   A       Dm
Youth must have some dalliance Of good or ill some pastance
Dm        C           Am       Dm           C       A    Dm
Company methinks then best All thoughts and fancies to digest
    Dm C F      Dm    C   F       C     Am 
For idleness is chief mistress Of vices all; 
     Dm  C   F       Dm    C   F       C    A  Dm  | Dm | 
then who can say But mirth and play Is best of all?

Virtue to use Vice to refuse Thus shall I use me...
