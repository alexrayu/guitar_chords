Am
Underneath the harvest moon
Where the ancient shadows will play and hide
                            F Em    Am
With a ghostly tune and the devil's pride
"Stranger" whispered all the town
Has he come to save us from Satan's hand?
                       F Em    Am
Leading them away to a foreign land

C
Play for me, minstrel, play
    G             Am
And take away our sorrows
C
Play for me, minstrel, play
          G  Am
And we'll follow
C
Hear, listen, can you hear,
    G                  Am
The haunting melody surrounding you,
C                          G     Am
Weaving a magic spell all around you


Danger hidden in his eyes,
We should have seen it from far away,
Wearing such a thin disguise in the light of day
He held the answer to our prayers,
Yet it was too good to be
Proof before our eyes, yet we could not see
