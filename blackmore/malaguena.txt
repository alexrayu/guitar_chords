E                        F            E
Silent she rose from the cold desert sands
F          G       F           E
Painted in shadows, a dark caravan
                       F             E
Quiet as a whisper with moves like a cat
    F            G                F            E
She ruled like a storm cloud, her eyes glowing black

[Chorus]
Am                     G
Oh, and they cried Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
              E
I remember it well
Am                   G
Oh, and they cry Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
N.C.          F N.C.          E
I remember it,  I remember it well
E
Oh, too well

[Verse]
                   F           E
And so they rode on wings of a song
F           G       F                    E
Spinning in silence, the world was their own
                    F                E
Two lovers locked in the arms of the dance
F         G           F         E
Freedom begins with a game of a chance

[Chorus]
Am                     G
Oh, and they cried Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
              E
I remember it well
Am                   G
Oh, and they cry Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
N.C.          F N.C.          E
I remember it,  I remember it well

[Verse]
E                        F           E
And now they rise like a wave on the seas
F         G     F                 E
Lost in a rhythm and ever they'll be

[Chorus]
Am                     G
Oh, and they cried Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
              E
I remember it well
     Am                    G
Ohhh ohh, and they cry Malagueña
                F
Wait for me Malagueña
N.C.          F N.C.          E
I remember it,  I remember it well
E
Oh, too well
