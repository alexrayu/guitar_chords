   C        F           G          C
As I went a walking One morning in spring
  Am            Dm              G           C
I met with some travelers On an old country lane
C          F           G        C
One was an old man The second a maid
    Am          Dm            G            C
The third was a young boy who smiled as he said
 
         F           C           F            C
With the wind in the willows The birds in the sky
          F             C           Dm      G
There's a bright sun to warm us wherever we lie...
   C              F            G          C
We have bread and fishes and a jug of red wine
   Am           Dm           G            C   F | G Em | Am Dm | G C |
To share on our journey with all... of mankind.
 
     C             F             G               C
So I asked them to tell me their names and their race
   Am        Dm          G              C
So I could remember each smile on their face
     C                F              G                 C
"Our names, they mean nothing...They change throughout time
   Am         Dm          G            C
So come sit beside us and share in our wine"
 
         F           C           F            C
With the wind in the willows The birds in the sky
          F             C           Dm      G
There's a bright sun to warm us wherever we lie...
   C              F            G          C
We have bread and fishes and a jug of red wine
   Am           Dm           G            C   F | G Em | Am Dm | G C |
To share on our journey with all... of mankind.
 
     C          F              G             C
So I sat down beside them With flowers all around
   Am         Dm            G          C
We ate from a mantle Spread out on the ground
     C          F            G           C
They told me of prophets And peoples and kings
    Am         Dm           G          C
And all of the one god that knows everything
 
       C            F            G               C
"We're traveling to Glaston Over England's green lanes
   Am            Dm          G             C
To hear of men's troubles To hear of their pains
   C          F               G            C
We travel the wide world Over land and the sea
   Am           Dm              G      C
To tell all the people How they can be free..."
 
         F           C           F            C
With the wind in the willows The birds in the sky
          F             C           Dm      G
There's a bright sun to warm us wherever we lie...
   C              F            G          C
We have bread and fishes and a jug of red wine
   Am           Dm           G            C   F | G Em | Am Dm | G C |
To share on our journey with all... of mankind.
 
   C       F                 G           C
So sadly I left them On that old country lane
    Am          Dm        G          C
For I knew that I'd never see them again
C          F           G        C
One was an old man The second a maid
    Am          Dm            G            C
The third was a young boy who smiled as he said...
 
         F           C           F            C
With the wind in the willows The birds in the sky
          F             C           Dm      G
There's a bright sun to warm us wherever we lie...
   C              F            G          C
We have bread and fishes and a jug of red wine
   Am           Dm           G         C
To share on our journey with all of mankind.
 
         F           C           F            C
