Am	          G		Am
Over on the hill, there grows a flower
Am		G		           Am
Growing quicker still, more perfect by the hour
Am	         C	      G    Am
Deep within that flower, is a tiny chair 
F	      Dm   G	     Em		      Am
All a-fringed with gold, the fairy queen sits there…

Am		     G		        Am
It is in her breath, that the wind does blow
Am	      G				Am
It is in her heart , as pure as winter snow
Am		    C	       G       Am
It is in her tears, crystal raindrops fall
F	       G	   Em		Am
And within her years, that she is in us all…

F       G		          Am
Oh dark eyes, help me see
         C            G
Just one look, she is gone,
        Dm         Am 
Look on me, we are one
   F   G        A       Am
Fading with the setting sun…

Am	      G  	    Am 
As the willow bows , to her majesty
Am		G		  Am
All the forest flowers, love her mystery
Am	       C           G	     Am
Who would not admire, who could not adore
F	      G		 Em		Am
Who does not desire, who wishes to see more?


F   G		              Am
Oh dark eyes, help me see
Am	     C	          G
Just one look, she is gone,
G     	Dm	       Am 
Look on me, we are one
       F	      G     	Am
Fading with the setting sun…  3X
