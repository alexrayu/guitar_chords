Am                Dm        Am
Oh, to my dearest ruler and lord
Dm       F       E          Am
Merciful husband Noblest of kings...
     Am                Dm         Am
Your heart of gold has long since tarnished
Dm    F            E                Am
In my chamber What will the morning bring?
Dm        C          G      C
Was it my heart that doth betray me
F       E          Am  Am7/G  E
Cause I loved more than one   man?
Am                     Dm      Am
Is it true your wear a wounded spirit?
Dm          F           E              Am
Pray let me mend it and make our love anew...

  Am                Dm     Am
Allow me to be your humble servant
Dm     F    E    Am
Once again, as before...
Am                       Dm          Am
Are you like the others, so quick to judge
Dm      F        E          Am
And for this the queen must fall
Dm        C          G      C
Was it my heart that doth betray me
F       E          Am  Am7/G  E
Cause I loved more than one   man?
Am                        Dm   Am
Truth within the writings of a letter
Dm         F           E                  Am
Signed and sealed poor Catherine Howard's fate...
Am                        Dm   Am

Signed and sealed poor Catherine Howard's fate...
