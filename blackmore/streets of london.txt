 
C		   G		  Am		Em
Have you seen the old man in the closed down market,
F		C		D	   G
Kicking out the papers with his worn out shoes?
C		   G		Am	       	Em
In his eyes you see no pride.  Hand held loosely by his side,
F	     C		   G           C
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news.

CHORUS
         F          C		   G   C
     So how can you tell me you're lonely,
	D				    G
     And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
     C               G               Am	                  Em
     Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London,
     F              C                  G                  C
     I'll show you something that'll make you change your mind.


Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London?
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags.
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking,
Carrying her home in two carrier bags.

CHORUS

In the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven,
Same old man sitting there on his own.
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea cup,
Each tea lasts a hour, then he wanders home alone.

CHORUS

Have you seen the old man outside the seamen's mission?
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears.
In this lonesome city the rain cries a little pity,
For one more forgotten hero in a world that doesn't care.

CHORUS
