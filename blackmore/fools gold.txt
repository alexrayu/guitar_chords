The one eyed jester skips and turns As he makes his way through the crowd
Am        Dm       G    Am     F      G      Am    | Am |
While the tavern's royalty try not to laugh aloud...

    Am     Dm     G     Am       F          G      Am
The jester does another spin And then falls to the floor
  Am      Dm       G         Am      F        G         Am
A show of hands, a short "Hurrah!" A plea for him to do more...
    C       G        C        G                Dm     F       E Esus4 | E7 |
The ease of laughter comes so fast when you're not in A jester's shoes

The king he sits upon his throne The worlds weight on his chest
Am        Dm     G       Am          F      G       Am
When your mind begins to race you've got no time to rest

"Where is my clown? I need him now, to take my troubles away..."
