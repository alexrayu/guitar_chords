Verse:
Am   F            G           C
 Solitaire with a song in her heart
     F            G        C
But what is that song to sing?
Am          F      E          Am
Turned her back on all that she knew
         F          G     C
In the hopes of a golden ring

Chorus:
         Am    F   G
And the rains came down
         Am   F             G
And the stars fell from the sky
        Am  F    G
Oh how dark the night
     F      C           G          Am
It always seems those castles and dreams
 F              G      A
Fade with the morning light
   E
(guitar solo)

Verse:
Am     F   G C
Such a sad story
      F     G       C
That time loves to tell
Am      F    E           Am
Copper coins shine for the sun
           F           G       C
From the floor of the wishing well

Chorus:
         Am    F   G
And the rains came down
         Am   F             G
And the stars fell from the sky
        Am  F    G
Oh how dark the night
     F      C           G          Am
It always seems those castles and dreams
 F              G      A
Fade with the morning light
   A
(guitar solo)


Bridge:
 F         Am        F                  Am
La dah dah…la dah dah…la dah dah, dah dah dah
 F         Am         F          E
La dah dah…la dah dah…la dah dah dah


Verse:
Am      F        G   C
So the jewel of jeopardy
  F               G         C
Shines with each dangerous step
Am   F      Em          Am
So unsure of what we’ve become
         F        G            C
What we have and what we have left


Chorus x2:
         Am    F   G
And the rains came down
         Am   F             G
And the stars fell from the sky
        Am  F    G
Oh how dark the night
     F      C           G          Am
It always seems those castles and dreams
 F              G      A
Fade with the morning light


Outro:
     F      C           G          Am
It always seems those castles and dreams
 F              G       A
Fade with the morning light
