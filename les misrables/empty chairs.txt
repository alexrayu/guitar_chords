    There's a grief that can't be spoken.
                           G   - C
There's a pain goes on and on.
                      Am
Empty chairs at empty tables
         B                  Em
Now my friends are dead and gone.
 
Em
    Here they talked of revolution.
                          G     - C
Here it was they lit the flame.
                        Am
Here they sang about `tomorrow'
       B            Em
And tomorrow never came.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          G    G7      C
From the table in the corner
           Gm7     C7     F
They could see a world reborn
          D/F#              G
And they rose with voices ringing
       F        E
I can hear them now!
          Am         Am7      F
The very words that they had sung
   Dm                D7
Became their last communion
C/G                     G6      Em
    On the lonely barricade at dawn.
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em
    Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
                         G    - C
That I live and you are gone.
                               Am
There's a grief that can't be spoken.
           B               G#m
There's a pain goes on and on.
 
G#m
    Phantom faces at the window.
                        B
Phantom shadows on the floor.
                       C#m
Empty chairs at empty tables
           D#                  G#m
Where my friends will meet no more.
 
G#m
    Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
                         B
What your sacrifice was for
                      C#m
Empty chairs at empty tables
           D#                 G#m       G#m7       G#m6       G#m
Where my friends will sing no more.
