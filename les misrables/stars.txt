(Verse 1)
 
C      G          Am
There, out in the darkness
  G        F
A fugitive running
C           G
Fallen from god
G           C
Fallen from grace
G         Am
God be my witness
  G           F
I never shall yield
Dm                   G
Till we come face to face
G                    Am
Till we come face to face
Am                      Dm
He knows his way in the dark
G                       Em
Mine is the way of the Lord
                         F
And those who follow the path of the righteous
                   C
Shall have their reward
            F
And if they fall

As Lucifer fell
    D
The flame
    G
The sword!
 
Stars
In your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night
 
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season
Returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame!

G              C               Em
And so it must be and so it is written
         Bb          F
On the doorway to paradise
               G                    C
That those who falter and those who fall
     Dm      G
Must pay the price!
 
C G C
 
G            F
Lord let me find him
F          G
That I may see him
F           C
Safe behind bars
G        F
I will never rest
      Dm
Till then
        G
This I swear
                      C           G   C
This I swear by the stars! (The final note is sung through the G and C)
