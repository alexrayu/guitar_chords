(Verse 1)
 
C      G          Am
There, out in the darkness
  G        F
A fugitive running
C           G
Fallen from god
G           C
Fallen from grace
G         Am
God be my witness
  G           F
I never shall yield
Dm                   G
Till we come face to face
G                    Am
Till we come face to face
Am                      Dm
He knows his way in the dark
G                       Em
Mine is the way of the Lord
                         F
And those who follow the path of the righteous
                   C
Shall have their reward
            F
And if they fall

As Lucifer fell
    D
The flame
    G
The sword!

 C     G       Am
Stars, in your multitudes
G            F
Scarce to be counted
C           G
Filling the darkness
G              C
With order and light
G           Am
You are the sentinels
G          F
Silent and sure
Dm                   G
Keeping watch in the night
G                    Am
Keeping watch in the night
Am                         Dm
You know your place in the sky
G                             Em
You hold your course and your aim
                        F
And each in your season returns and returns
                   C
And is always the same
            F
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
    Dm      E
You fall in flame!
 
(Bridge to Outro:)
 
 
G              C               Em
And so it must be and so it is written
         Bb          F
On the doorway to paradise
               G                    C
That those who falter and those who fall
     Dm      G
Must pay the price!
 
C G C
 
G            F
Lord let me find him
F          G
That I may see him
F           C
Safe behind bars
G        F
I will never rest
      Dm
Till then
        G
This I swear
                      C           G   C
This I swear by the stars! (The final note is sung through the G and C)
