Em                                       Am
At the end of the day you're another day older
Em                                             A
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
G                      D
It's a struggle, it's a war
G                                D
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
         Em           B                 C
One more day standing about, what is it for?
                   Em
One day less to be living.
 
 
Em                                       Am
At the end of the day you're another day colder
Em                                              A
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
        G              D
And the righteous hurry past
           G                   D
They don't hear the little ones crying
        Em                  B              C
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill
                  Em
One day nearer to dying!
 
 
Em                                        A
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
E                                        A
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
         E                  B
Like the waves crash on the sand
       E                       B
Like a storm that'll break any second
          F            C
There's a hunger in the land
          F                    C
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and
        G               D
There's gonna be hell to pay
B
At the end of the day!
 
 
Em                                        Am
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Em                                        Am
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread
          G               D
There are children back at home
        G                      D
And the children have got to be fed
           Em               B
And you're lucky to be in a job
         C
And in a bed!
                       Em
And we're counting our blessings!
 
 
E                                      A
At the end of the day it's another day over
E                                        A
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
        E                 B
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
        E                          B
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
        F                C
Keep on grafting till you drop
        F                         C
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table
            G              D
Well you've got to pay your way
B                 Em
At the end of the day!
