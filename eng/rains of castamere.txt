    Am      E7       Am         E
And who are you, the proud lord said
     Am     E7     G
That I must bow so low?
 C     G        C         G
Only a cat of a different coat
       Dm              E7
That's all the truth I know
 
 
[Verse 2]
     Am      E7        Am      E
In a coat of gold or a coat of red
  Am   E7        G
A lion still has claws
    C        G        C         G
And mine are long and sharp, my lord
   Dm       E7       Am
As long and sharp as yours
 
 
[Chorus]
    Am               Em
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
     Am           Em
That lord of Castamere
    F                 Dm
But now the rains weep o'er his hall
     F     E7       Am
With no one there to hear
     F                 Dm
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
    F    E7      Am
And not a soul to hear
