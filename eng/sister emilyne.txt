Capo 3

Am
This dot on the map, my boy
G             C
This is Olive Springs
Dm             Am
And the circle round the star
Dm                 E
They call Saturn's ring

Am
Glass is made of sand, my boy
G                        C
And clouds with drops of rain
Dm           Am
Seasons only go away
Dm      E     Am   - G
To come back again

          C    - Am
Sister Emilyne
          C         Am      - Dm
Shared my childhood dreams
               Dm    - G
And the tender days
             C   - G
Slowly died away

              C     - Am
I can see her smile
     C           Am     - Dm
At a young boy's rhymes
                         Dm    - G
When "blue" rhymes with "true"
                     C    - G
And "dream" with "Emilyne"

Am
No one's always right, my boy
G                   C
Sometimes you'll be wrong
Dm                 Am
Give before you're asked to give
Dm                   E
Give your whole life long

Am
And when there's a goal to reach
G                C
Time's your only friend
Dm                           Am
You can change the course of things
Dm            E        Am  - G
But you can't stop the end

          C    - Am
Sister Emilyne
          C         Am      - Dm
Shared my childhood dreams
               Dm    - G
And the tender days
             C   - G
Slowly died away

              C     - Am
I can see her smile
     C           Am     - Dm
At a young boy's rhymes
                         Dm    - G
When "blue" rhymes with "true"
                     C    - G
And "dream" with "Emilyne"
