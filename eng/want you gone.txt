C
Well here we are again
F
It's always such a pleasure
C                          F           G
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
C
Oh, how we laughed and laughed
F
Except I wasn't laughing
C                        F              E
Under the circumstances I've been shockingly nice

[CHORUS]

A                D
You want your freedom take it
A                D
That's what I'm counting on
A         D
I used to want you dead but
F           G        C
Now I only want you gone

[VERSE]

C
She was a lot like you
F
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
C                      F        G
Now little Caroline is in here too
C
One day they woke me up
F
So I could live forever
C                                 F      E
It's such a shame the same will never happen to you

[CHORUS]

A                D
You've got your short, sad life left
A                D
That's what I'm counting on
A            D
I'll let you get right to it
F           G        C
Now I only want you gone

[VERSE]

C
Goodbye, my only friend

Oh, did you think I meant you?
C                          F
That would be funny if it weren't so sad
C
Well you have been replaced
F
I don't need anyone now
C                          F        E
When I delete you maybe I'll stop feeling so bad

[CHORUS]

A              D
Go make some new disaster
A                D
That's what I'm counting on
A               D
You're someone else's problem
F           G        C
Now I only want you gone
F           G        C
Now I only want you gone
F           G        C
Now I only want you gone
