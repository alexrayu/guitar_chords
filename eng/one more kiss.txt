C                   - Am
One more kiss, dear
E           E7
One more sigh
   C             Am7
Only this, dear
         D7
Is goodbye
         F           Fm
For our love is such pain
           C     Am7
And such pleasure
     D7                    G
That I'll treasure till I die


So for now, dear
Aurevoir, madame
But I vow dear, not farewell
For in time we may have a love's glory
Our love story to tell

 Fm
Just as every autumn
  C
Leaves fall from the tree
  Fm                      C
Tumble to the ground and die
  Fm
So in the springtime
  C                Am7
Like sweet memories
  D7                     G
They will return as will I


Like the sun, dear
Upon high
We'll return, dear
To the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow goodbye
