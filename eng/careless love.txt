E                  B7        E
Love, oh, love oh care-less love.
                             B7
Love, oh, love oh care-less love.
E          E7        A
Love, oh, love, oh, care-less love,
E        B7                E
See what careless love has done.

[Verse 1]
E                  B7   E
I love my mama and papa too,
                        B7
I love my mama and papa too,
E                   E7    A
I love my mama and papa too,
     E                 B7      E
I'd leave them both to go with you.


[Verse 2]
E                    B7   E
What, oh what, will mama say,
                          B7
What, oh what, will mama say,
E          E7        A
What, oh what, will mama say,
     E                 B7     E
When she learns I've gone astray.


[Verse 3]
E                 B7  E
Once I wore my apron low,
                      B7
Once I wore my apron low,
E               E7    A
Once I wore my apron low,
   E                B7               E
I couldn't scarely keep you from my door.

[Verse 4]
E               B7          E
Now my apron strings don't pin,
                            B7
Now my apron strings don't pin,
E      E7                   A
Now my apron strings don't pin,
     E                    B7     E
You pass my door and you don't come in.

[Chorus]
E                  B7        E
Love, oh, love oh care-less love.
                             B7
Love, oh, love oh care-less love.
E          E7        A
Love, oh, love, oh, care-less love,
E        B7                E
See what careless love has done.
