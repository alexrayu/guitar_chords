[Verse 1]
C               Am    C          Am
Leaves from the vine, falling so slow;
E                 Am      E               Am
Like fragile tiny shells, drifting in the foam.
C              Am   C             Am
Little soldier boy, come marching home.
E             Am  E              Am
Brave soldier boy comes marching home.
 
[Verse 2]
C          Am    C          Am
Ash in the snow, falling so slow;
     E               Am          E           Am
Like fragile, broken hearts with no place to go.
C              Am   C             Am
Little soldier boy, come marching home.
E             Am   E             Am
Brave soldier boy, come marching home.
 

[Verse 3]
C               Am    C           Am
Leaves from the vine, changing so slow
E                  Am     E             Am
Like empty, fallen souls, looking for a home.
C              Am   C                     Am
Little soldier boy, thought that he could soar
E             Am   E           Am
Brave soldier boy, died in the war.
