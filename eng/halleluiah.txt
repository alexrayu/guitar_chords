  G                 Em 
I heard there was a secret chord 
      G                   Em 
that David played and it pleased the Lord 
     C                        D        G       D
but you don't really care for music do you? 
         G 
well it goes like this 
     C          D         Em                 C 
the fourth the fifth the minor fall and the major lift 
     D             B7            Em 
the baffled king composing Hallelujah 
 

[Chorus]

      C           Em        C      G  D G 
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 


[Verse]

     G                        Em
Your faith was strong but you needed proof 
    G               Em
you saw her bathing on the roof 
    C              D          D7    G         D
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
    G              C        D
she tied you to her kitchen chair 
    Em                        C
she broke your throne and she cut your hair 
    D                  B7          Em
and from your lips you drew a Hallelujah 


[Chorus]

     C          Em         C          G D    G 
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu  -  jah 


[Verse]

 G             Em 
baby I've been here before 
     G                       Em
i've seen this room and I've walked this floor 
  C             D      D7      G           D
i used to live alone before I knew you 
         G                     C      D
and I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
    Em            C
and love is not a victory march 
       D               B7           Em
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
 

[Chorus]

     C         Em          C        G D     G
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 


[Verse]

G                         Em
there was a time when you let me know 
       G            Em
what's really going on below 
    C              D        D7     G          D
but now you never show that to me do you? 
    G               C        D
but remember when I moved in you 
        Em            C
and the holy dove was moving too 
    D               B7             Em
and every breath we drew was Hallelujah 


[Chorus]

     C          Em         C          G D    G 
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 


[Verse]

G               Em 
maybe there's a God above 
    G              Em
but all I've ever learned from love 
    C               D        D7      G          D
was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
    G                       C       D
and it's not a cry that you hear at night 
     Em                 C
it's not somebody who's seen the light 
       D               B7           Em
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 


[Chorus]

     C          Em         C         G D   G
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Halleluuuu 
     C          Em         C         G D    G
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Halleluuuuujah
