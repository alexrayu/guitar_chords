Capo 3

         Am                        F              G
When the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain
        Am                     F          G
And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain
       Am            Em                 F              C
In the shadow of the forest, though she may be old and worn
          F          C
They will stare unbelieving
       F       G       N.C
At the last unicorn
 
[Verse 2]
         Am                                 F          G
When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing
        Am                      F            G
And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising
       Am                Em              F                  C
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn
       F                 C
In the distance hear her laughter
       F       G
Of the last unicorn
      C Am
I'm alive 
      G   Am  Em   F   G
I'm alive 
 
[Verse 3]
         Am                         F            G
When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning
         Am                               F              G
And  the future has passed without even a last desperate warning
     Am            Em                    F                C
Then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is formed
         F               C
Look and see her how she sparkles
         F       G
It's the last unicorn
      C Am
I'm alive 
      G   Am  Em   F   G
I'm alive
