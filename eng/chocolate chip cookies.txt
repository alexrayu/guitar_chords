         D                         Em               A
When the sunlight has gone and the green hills turn grey
        D                        Em   - A
And the day turns to evening somehow
         D                              G
Then I'm thinking of you, though you're so far away
        D           A           D    - A
And I'm wanting you close to me now

[Chorus]
    D                         G           D
Oh, Chocolate Chip Cookies so high on the shelf
D                    Em  - A
Hiding inside of the jar
    D        G         A         Bm
I'm not tall enough to reach you myself
   D         G           D 
So near, and yet so very far

[Verse 2]
I can never forget you, you're all I adore
Through many long moments I've tried
I call out your name but I'll have to do more
To bring you back here to my side

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
   G                         D   
If I had three wishes they'd all be for you
   A                     D
If I had my way you'd be mine 
        Bm                       E       
Oh, the reach wouldn't matter if I had a ladder
   Em                         A7
If I weren't so short we'd be fine

[Verse 4]
I believe we will be back together some day
I cannot be happy till then
I have loved you before
I could love you some more
And I long to be with you again

When the sunlight has gone and the green hills turn grey

[Chorus]
Oh, Chocolate Chip Cookies so high on the shelf
Hiding inside of the jar
I'm not tall enough to reach you myself
So near, and yet so very far

[Outro]
And I wish I could be where you are
