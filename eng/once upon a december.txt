 
[Intro]
Am

[Verse]
Am      E     A7      D
Dancing bears painted wings
Dm         Am     D E
Things I almost remember
Am    E    A7      D
And a song someone sings
D    Am      E  Am
Once upon a December

[Chorus]
D                Am
Someone holds me safe and warm
E                       Am
Horses prance through a silver storm
D               Am
Figures dancing gracefully
B7            E
Across my memory

[Verse]
Am   E    A7    D
Far away long ago
D       Am        D  E
Glowing dim as an ember
Am        E      A7      D 
Things my heart used to know
D     Am      E  Am
Once upon a December

[Interlude]
Am  E  A7 Dm
D   Am D  E 
Am  E  A7 D
D   Am E  Am

[Chorus]
D                Am
Someone holds me safe and warm
E                       Am
Horses prance through a silver storm
D               Am
Figures dancing gracefully
B7        E 
Across my memory

[Verse]
Am   E    A7    D
Far away long ago
D       Am        D  E
Glowing dim as an ember
Am        E     A7      D
Things my heart used to know
D          Am        D   E
Things it yearns to remember
Am     E       A7    D
And a song, someone sings
D     Am    E     Am
Once upon a December
