[Verse 1]
        Am
So it's into the Void
       Em           G
Now me girls and me boys
     Am                G
From Mother's hands we go
         Dm
We'll be sailing to the sun
         Am
Till the voyage is done
              Dm              G      Am
Then we'll be sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
F         C      Am
Sisters! Below, below
      Dm                          Am
We're going where the winds don't blow
          F         G
Yes we're all bound down
       C              Am
To the deep and we'll all be
Dm              G      Am     C
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Dm              G      Am

[Verse 2]
    Am
Our sailing ship's
        Em           G
For the hard and the quick
   Am                G 
We roll our load and go
          Dm
There's a living to be madе
           Am
Or there's Hell to pay
            Dm              G    Am
Whеn you're sleeping in the cold below

Yes we're all bound down

To the deep and we'll all be
Dm              G      Am     C
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Dm              G      Am
Sleeping in the cold below

[Verse 3]
          Am
There's a man on high
         Em           G
With the Devil in his eye
      Am               G
And a golden hand, I'm told
       Dm
It can hurt you, it can hold you
       Am
He can kick you or console you
            Dm              G      Am
When you're sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
F         C      Am
Sisters! Below, below

We're going where the winds don't blow
          F         G
Yes we're all bound down
       C              Am
To the deep and we'll all be
Dm              G      Am     C
Sleeping in the cold below, below
Dm              G      Am
Sleeping in the cold below

[Bridge]
   Am
Oh Sisters you
   Em       G
So wise and true
     Am              G
When it's my time to go
          Dm
Won't you lay me down
      Am
Under Granum Crowns
            Dm              G      Am     C
And I'll be sleeping in the cold below, below
Dm              G      Am
Sleeping in the cold below

[Chorus]
F         C      Am
Sisters! Below, below
      Dm                          Am
We're going where the winds don't blow
          F         G
Yes we're all bound down
       C              Am
To the deep and we'll all be
Dm              G      
Sleeping in the cold be... [cuts]

F         C      Am
Sisters! Below, below

[Outro]
         Am
Today we sail
       Em    G
On the Solar Rail
            Am                 G
For there's much we just don't know
       Dm
So farewell with a kiss
          Am
Then it's fast for the mist
               Dm              G    Am
Till we're all sleeping in the cold below
