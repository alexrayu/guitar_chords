Am - F - E

Am                    Dm               F        E
These scars long have yearned for your tender caress
    Am      D         G              E
To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own
F             Dm    F                 E
Rend my heart open, then your love profess
 Am                Dm               F     Am
A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone

[Chorus]

    Am
You flee my dream come the morning
     F
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   Am                     F        Dm
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
F         Dm    F                 E
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep

    Am          Dm     F        E
The wolf i will follow into the storm
   Am        D          G          E
To find your heart, its passion displaced
   F        Dm       F              E
By ire ever growing, hardening into stone
 Am                Dm            F       Am
Amidst the cold to hold you in a heated embrace

[Chorus]

    Am
You flee my dream come the morning
     F
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   Am                     F        Dm
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
F         Dm    F                 E
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep


[Verse 3]
(Geralt to Yennefer)

  Am          Dm              F         E
I know not if fate would have us live as one
   Am    D            G                 E
Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound
F         Dm         F            E
The wish i whispered, when it all began
Am             Dm             F         Am
Did it forge a love you might never have found?


[Chorus]
(Geralt to Yennefer)

    Am
You flee my dream come the morning
     F
Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
   Am                     F       Dm
To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
F        Dm    F                E
Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
