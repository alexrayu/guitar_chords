           C        Am
This was a triumph
             C          Am       C   
I’m making a note here: huge success
Dm               G             C   
It’s hard to overstate my satisfaction
Am       C       
Aperture Science
Am            C      Am       C 
We do what we must because we can
Dm                     G
For the good of all of us
           Dm            G            
Except the ones who are dead
D                    A           G        D
But there’s no sense crying over every mistake
D                A               G          D
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
G                    A            D           G
And the science gets done and you make a neat gun
A                             D 
For the people who are still alive


I’m not even angry
I’m being so sincere right now
Even though you broke my heart and killed me
And tore me to pieces
And threw every piece into a fire
As they burned it hurt because
I was so happy for you
Now these points of data make a beautiful line
And we’re out of beta, we’re releasing on time
So I’m glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned
For the people who are still alive

Go ahead and leave me
I think I’d prefer to stay inside
Maybe you’ll find someone else to help you
Maybe Black Mesa
That was a joke, ha ha, fat chance
Anyway this cake is great
It’s so delicious and moist
Look at me still talking when there’s science to do
When I look out there it makes me glad I’m not you
I’ve experiments to run, there is research to be done
On the people who are still alive

       Am        C         Am     C
And believe me I am still alive
          Am          C          Am     C
I’m doing science and I’m still alive
       Am            C          Am     C
I feel fantastic and I’m still alive
                 Am         C         Am     C
And while you’re dying I’ll be still alive
                Am          C         Am     C
And when you’re dead I will be still alive
C      Am
Still alive
C      Am
Still alive
