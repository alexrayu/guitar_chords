[Verse 1]
Am            Dm         Am
Wolves asleep amidst the trees
Dm                 E7        Am
Bats all a swaying in the breeze
Am                        Dm   Am
But one soul lies anxious wide awake
Dm                     E7              Am
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths
 
 
[Chorus]
        Am              E7
For your dolly Polly sleep has flown
        Am         E7
Don't dare let her tremble alone
        Am                   E7
For the witcher, heartless, cold
Dm               Am
Paid in coin of gold
Dm                     Am
He comes he'll go leave naught behind
     E7           Am
But heartache and woe
E7         Am
Deep, deep woe
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am                Dm     Am
Birds are silent for the night
Dm                 E7        Am
Cows turned in as daylight dies
Am                        Dm   Am
But one soul lies anxious wide awake
Dm                     E7              Am
Fearing all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths
 
 
[Chorus]
        Am              E7
My dear dolly Polly shut your eyes
        Am              E7
Lie still, lie silent, utter no cries
        Am                  E7
As the witcher, brave and bold
Dm               Am
Paid in coin of gold
Dm
He'll chop and slice you
Am
Cut and dice you
E7           Am
Eat you up whole
E7          Am
Eat you whole
