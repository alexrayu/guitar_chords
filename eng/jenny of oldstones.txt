Cappo 4 (maybe)

Am                       C             G
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Dm                         Am
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
                              C            G
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
Dm                   G             Am
And the ones who had loved her the most

Am                           C       G
The ones who'd been gone for so very long
    Dm                      Am
She couldn't remember their names
                            C        G
They spun her around on the damp old stones
      Dm          G          F
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

[Chorus]
        Dm              C      Dm              Am
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
G               C      Dm    E         Am    - G
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave 

They danced through the day and into the night
Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again
'Til the walls did crumble and fall

[Chorus]

Repeat 1.
