Em             Am     Em                    Am  
My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral
G                       Am     Em                         Am  
Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
Em                  Am         Em                  Am       
If the Heavens ever did speak, sheâ€™s the last true mouthpiece
G                      Am            Em           Am      
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
D                      C                
We were born sick, you heard them say it...
Em                  Am             Em                       Am      
My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
    G                   Am      Em                Am     
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
D                C
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well

G           C G  Cm G Cm G
A-A-A-A-A-  Amen Amen Amen


[Chorus](2x)
G G          Em
  Take me to church                 
                                               B7
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                       Am-G-G- (Em)
Good God, let me give you my life

    
Em                 Am          Em             Am
I'm a pagan of the good times, my lover's the sunlight
   G                   Am      Em               Am
To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacrifice
D                    C
Drain the whole sea, get something shiny...
Em                      Am           Em                    Am
Something meaty for the main course, that's a fine looking high horse
G                   Am      Em                      Am   
What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful
D                 C    
That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work


Chorus


C             G              B7       Em
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
C                   G              B7         Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
C                  G            B7          Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C         G           B7        Em        C G   
Only then I am human, only then I am clean     Oh

C G  C  G  Cm G  Cm G
Oh   Amen  Amen  Amen

Chorus
