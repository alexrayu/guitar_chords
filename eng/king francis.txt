King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,
    Am              F     Am          G              Am
And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court.
    Dm                C                 G               Em
The nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in their pride,
     Am                  F        Am          G               Am
And ’mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:
    Dm             C                G                 Em
And truly ’t was a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Am                    F     Am            G              Am
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.
Dm                    C                   G            Am
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.

Am                    F Am        G               Am
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
     Am                     F          Am       G                    Am
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;
     Dm                          C         G              Em
With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another,
     Am               F        Am            G          Am
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;
    Dm           C                  G                    Em
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;
     Am                    F     Am         G                Am
Said Francis then, “Faith, gentlemen, we’re better here than there.”
     Dm                    C                G                Am
Said Francis then, “Faith, gentlemen, we’re better here than there.”

De Lorge’s love o’erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame,
     Am               F            Am                 G          Am
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same;
    Dm                     C         G                  Em
She thought, the Count, my lover, is brave as brave can be;
   Am              F        Am        G                Am
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;
      Dm      C                        G             Em
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;
     Am                F         Am          G             Am
I’ll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine.
     Dm                C                     G             Am
I’ll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine.

    Am                    F         Am         G                 Am
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;
   Am              F      Am      G              Am
He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild;
    Dm                C                  G                 Em
The leap was quick, return was quick, he has regained his place,
     Am                   F        Am          G             Am
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady’s face.
    Dm                      C                     G                  Em
“By Heaven,” said Francis, “rightly done!” and he rose from where he sat;
    Am                    F   Am       G                Am
“No love,” quoth he, “but vanity, sets love a task like that.”
    Dm                    C            G                Am
“No love,” quoth he, “but vanity, sets love a task like that.”
