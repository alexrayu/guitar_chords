[Capo 3]

[Verse 1]
Am                       Dm            G
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Am                         G
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
    Am                        G            Dm
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
    G                              Am
And the ones who had loved her the most


[Verse 2]
    Am                       Dm      G
The ones who’d been gone for so very long
    Am                      G
She couldn’t remember their names
     Am                     G        Dm
They spun her around on the damp old stones
     G                       Am
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

[Chorus]
        G               Am
And she never wanted to leave
Dm              Am     G               Am
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Dm              Am
Never wanted to leave
G               Am     Dm              Am
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
