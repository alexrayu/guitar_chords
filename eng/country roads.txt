C              Am             G                         F         C
Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
C                 Am                    G                          
Life is old here, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, 
F             C
Blowin like a breeze.

[Chorus]

        C              G          Am               F
Country Roads, take me home, to a place, where I belong, 
        C               G             F             C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]

C               Am                G                 F              C
All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
C                 Am                  G                         
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, 
F            C 
Teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]

        C              G          Am               F
Country Roads, take me home, to a place, where I belong, 
        C               G             F             C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Bridge]

Am           G            C                           
 I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me, 
      F       C              G
 The radio reminds me of my home far away.
      Am               A#            F
 And driving down the road I get a feeling 
          C                          G          G7
 That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

[Chorus]

          C              G          Am               F
 Country Roads, take me home, to a place, where I belong, 
          C               G             F             C
 West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
          C              G          Am               F
 Country Roads, take me home, to a place, where I belong, 
          C               G             F             C
 West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
          G             C              G                  C
 Take me home, country roads; take me home, down country roads
