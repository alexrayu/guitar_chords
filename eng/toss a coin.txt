      Am       D
When a humble bard
               Dm
Graced a ride along
                 G
With Geralt of Rivia
     D           G  E7
Along came this song
 
[Verse 2]
       Am                   D
From when the White Wolf fought
                   F
A silver-tongued devil
               G
His army of elves
                         E7
At his hooves did they revel
 
[Verse 3]
      Am       D
They came after me
                F
With masterful deceit
                 G
Broke down my lute
                 Am
And they kicked in my teeth
 
[Verse 4]
      Am       D
While the devil’s horns
                 F
Minced our tender meat
                    G
And so cried the Witcher
               Em7
He can’t be bleat
 
[Chorus]
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to your Witcher
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
Am
O’
 
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to Your Witcher
D                E7
O’ Valley of Plenty
 
[Verse 5]
      Am             D
At the edge of the world
                   F
Fight the mighty horde
                  G
That bashes and breaks you
                  Em7
And brings you to mourn
 
[Verse 6]
  Am            D
He thrust every elf
               F
Far back on the shelf
               G
High up on the mountain
               Em7
From whence it came
 
[Verse 7]
      Am       D
He wiped out your pest
                F
Got kicked in his chest
                G
He’s a friend of humanity
                Em7
So give him the rest
 
[Verse 8]
Am            D
That’s my epic tale
               F
Our champion prevailed
               G
Defeated the villain
                E7
Now pour him some ale
 
[Chorus]
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to your Witcher
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
Am
O’
 
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to your Witcher
D                E7
And friend of humanity
 
[Chorus]
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to your Witcher
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
D           Am
O’ Valley of Plenty
Am
O’
 
Am           E7       C
Toss a coin to your Witcher
D                E7
And friend of humanity
