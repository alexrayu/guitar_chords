Am/C  E7  Am

[Verse 1]
  Am/C          E7          Am
I hear you’re alive, how disappointing
    Am/C     E7         Am
I’ve also survived, no thanks to you
      Am                 G
Did I not bring you some glee
    Am         E7
Mr. Oh-Look-At-Me
     Am               E7       Am
Now I’ll burn all the memories of you

[Verse 2]
          C            | E7      Am   - E7
All those lonely miles  that you ride
        C            E7          Am   - E7
Now you walk with no one by your side
       Am         G
Did you ever even care
          Am              E7
With your swords and your stupid hair, now watch me laugh
          | Am/C   E7          Am
As I burn  all the memories of you

[Bridge]
  Am
Ladies and gentlemen
You have been the most beautiful audience!
Remember to toss a coin if you can
If anyone needs me, I'll be at the bar

[Chorus]
                Am
What for do you yearn?
                    Dm
It’s the point of no return
      E
After everything we did, we saw
    E7
You turned your back on me

               Am  G  C
What for do you yearn?
                   Dm
Watch that Butcher burn!
       E
At the end of my days when I’m through
     E
No word that I’ve written
     E7
Will ring quite as true

[Post-chorus]
  Am
As burn
               Dm6
Burn, Butcher, burn!
               E7
Burn, Butcher, burn!
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn...

[Outro]
        Am/C          E7       Am
Watch me burn all the memories of you
