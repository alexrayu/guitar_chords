G
Peering out of tiny eyes
   Bm/F#
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
F
Wiped the window clean of frost
C/E                     G
As the morning air laid on the latch

A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded must be displayed

A                   D                  D/C
Large hands lift him through the air
Bm7           Esus4          E
Excited eyes contain him there
C                    G
The eyes of those he loves and knows
F6                      Dsus4      D7
But what's this extra bed just here

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

Am               Dsus4              D
And all you ever learned from them
Bm7                         Esus4  E
Until you grew much older
Am                          C
Did not compare with when they said
G              Bm           Em       G7
This is your brand new brother
Cmaj7+9    D6             G     D/F#
This is your brand new brother
Cmaj7/E     Dsus4   D      G
This is your brand new brother
