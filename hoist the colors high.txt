HOIST THE COLORS


Em 
Yo Ho Haul Together
                 Am
Hoist the Colors High
H7
Heave Ho, Thieves and Beggars
               Em
Never shall we die

    Em                         Am             Em
The king and his men stole the queen from her bed
    Am               H7
and bound her in her bones 
    Am               Em
the seas be ours and by the powers
H7               Em
where we will we roam

Some men have died some are alive
and others sail the sea
With the keys to the cage and the devil to pay
We lay for Fiddler's Green

The bell has been raised from it's water grave
Do you hear it sepuluchral tone?
We are a call to all pay heed to the squall
and turn you sails towards home

The brethern all called and assembled in the hall
Hoist the Jolly Rouge
with a warning to all who oppose our call,
that the Devil collects what is due
