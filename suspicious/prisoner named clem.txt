There once was a man who was sent to prison
    Dm                  Am
For six long months and no good reason
   Am
Oh did I say months - it was rather six years
        E                    Am
And the name of that man was Clem (Clem!)

Soon will the rebellion come
    Dm                     Am
And bring blue milk from a Bantha farm
F                C
One day when the Empire is down
      E               Am
We'll pack our gold'n go
