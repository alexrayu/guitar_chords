[Verse 1]
      Am   C        D      F
There is a house in Novo-sibirsk
     Am        C       E     E
They call the "Setting Sun"
         Am       C       D           F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am     E         Am
And God, I know, I'm one

[Verse 2]
        Am     C        D           F
There's also a house in Novo-sibirsk

They call the "Rising Moon"
         Am          C     D             F
And they drink vodka there with the polar bear
     Am        E    Am
From dusk till very noon

[Verse 3]
   Am     C     D        F
My mother was a traitor (organ: F7)
         Am    C        E        E
She sold Lenin for blue jeans
   Am     C     D     F
My father was a party member
Am      E      Am
Down in Novo-sibirsk.

        Am   C       D      F
Now the only thing a member needs (organ: F7)
     Am       C     E     E
Is a suitcase and a trunk (organ: E7)
        Am   C      D        F
And the only time, he's satisfied,
   Am        E    Am
Is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 5]
        Am      C           D           F
Well, I got one foot on the platform
    Am       C    E     E
I'm shipping to Ukraine (organ: E7)
    Am       C        D        F
I'm going to flourish when I'm dead (organ: F7)
      Am         E           Am
For I have in my pocket some grain
