Am
He walked into the bar, a traveler from afar
                             C
He order whisky and assorted clams
Dm                        C
Ladies turned their heads for his leather pants
    Dm              G                Am
And men for his moustache and his guitar.

The waiter was enthrolled by how the evening rolled
For serving a walrus he'd never yet have a chance.
When the whisky was suffice, the traveler rolled his eyes
He unbuttoned his shirt and then began to dance.

Chorus
              Dm                     C
And they said walrus, will you dance for us?
        G                    C
And the walrus said, no, now way,
      Dm                C              G
There is no way I won't dance for you,
            Am
Of course I will!

The party rolled ahead, more whisky to be had
The dancing walrus had the bar entranced
The visitors felt great as he threw around his weight
The barman shocked by the gravity of his dance.

He left the dancing floor more slim he'd been before
And there fell deep silence in the bar
As he had another shot, and said, You know guys what!
It's time my friends I showed you my guitar.

Chorus
And they said walrus, will you sing to us?
And the walrus said, no, now way,
There is no way I won't sing to you,
Of course I will!

The morning drawing near, the visitors wiped their tears
And the barman said it was a holy night
The visitors said, Friend, you made us sing and dance!
And walrus said "And now, it's time to fight!"

The men said, "No screw that!" The ladies, "Go ahead!"
The barman said, "It's late, the bar is closed!"
The traveller said "Alas, you don't know how to dance".
He packed his guitar and then he hit the road.
