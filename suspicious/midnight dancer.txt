He walked into the bar, a traveler from afar
                               C
He ordered whisky and assorted clams
    Dm                        C
ladies turned their heads for his leather pants  |
    Dm             G                Am          | 2x
And men for his mustache and his guitar.        |

    Am
The waiter was enthralled by how the evening rolled
                                           C
For serving a walrus he'd never yet have a chance.
         Dm                       C
When the whisky was suffice, the traveler rolled his eyes
    Dm                      G             Am
He unbuttoned his shirt and then began to dance.

Chorus
              Dm                     C
And they said walrus, will you dance for us?
        G                   C
And the walrus said, no, no way,
      Dm                C              G
There is no way I won't dance for you,
            Am
Of course I will!

    Am
The party rolled ahead, more whisky to be had
                                C
The dancing walrus had the bar entranced
    Dm                                         C
The visitors felt great as he threw around his weight
    Dm                        G              Am
The barman was shocked by the gravity of his dance.

   Am
He left the dancing floor more slim he'd been before
                                     C
And there fell a deep silence in the bar
      Dm                                        C
As he had another shot, and said, You know guys what!
     Dm                G             Am
It's time my friends I showed you my guitar.

Chorus
              Dm                    C
And they said walrus, will you sing for us?
        G                   C
And the walrus said, no, no way,
      Dm                C              G
There is no way I won't sing for you,
            Am
Of course I will!

    Am                                             C
The morning drawing near, the visitors wiped their tears
                                  C
And the barman said it was a holy night
    Dm                                          C
The visitors said, Friend, you made us sing and dance!
    Dm                         G       Am
And walrus said "And now, it's time to fight!"

    Am                                      C
The men said, "No screw that!" The ladies, "Go ahead!"
                                        C
The barman said, "It's late, the bar is closed!"
    Dm                                          C
The traveller said "Alas, you don't know how to dance".
   Dm                            G       Am
He packed his guitar and then he hit the road.
