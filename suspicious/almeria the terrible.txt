  Em            B7
O heaven's holy Daughter, 
  Em            B7
O lady just and true,
   Em               C
To you we raise our voices
   Am              B7
We bow and worship you.


  Em
Almeria, the land where I was born,
                                      Am
The world of trees that tickle at the sky,
           Em                   C
Of grasses tall that soothe the traveler's eye -
           Am                       B7
You lavish all your children, I was told.

             Em
But no - not me. For how a child can be
          Am
Without a soul, unless you're born a clone?
            Em
Constructed from the genes of men long gone,
          Am                   B7
Of no one in particular - like me?



  Em        B7 
Almeria the Bountiful
    C               Em
You lavish all your kids
     C             Am
With sun and rains abundant
     C                B7
Your hand your people feeds.


             Em
I'm not your child, as I had vainly thought,
                                  Am
A bastard, rather, orphan to your kin.
           Em             C
O heaven's holy daughter, do you hate
            Am                      B7
The one who has but empty space within?

            Em
You bear me now, but when you can no more,
            Am                       D
Will you condemn my weak, bewildered ghost?
            Em                         Am
Will tender arms spread in embrace but close,
             C                   B7
When you see me arriving at your door?



Em          B7
Almeria the Terrible
   C             Em
In your maternal wrath
    C                   Am
You tread the grapes of vengeance
   C                  B7
Restore the righteous path.


            Em
Darkness of space I have instead of soul,
                                  Am
My name drawn out from History by chance,
        Em            C
My memories belong to someone else -
           Am                        B7
To men who lived and died long, long ago.


               Em
Like starlight in my dreams those memories flash;
             Am
They warm my heart with faint, forgotten light.
             Em                    C
I watch them from the bottom of my well,
           Am                             B7
Holding my breath - and oh, do they shine bright.



Bridge:
C        G
Naked we enter in this world,
    Am       Em
And naked we depart.
   C                      Em
We stand before you as we are,
   Am       B7        Em
Console and bless our heart.
