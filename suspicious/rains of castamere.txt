3 fret
 
    Am      E7       Am       E
And who are you, and you, and you
    Am              G
And you and you and you?
    C        G        C        G
And you, and you, and you, and you
    Dm               E7
And who the hell are you?
 
[Chorus]
    Am               Em
And so he spoke, and so he spoke
     Am           Em
That lord of Castamere
          F              Dm
But they tied him up and put to sleep
        F          E7        Am
For him drunk they could not bear
         F               Dm
Yes they tied him up and put to sleep
        F          E7        Am
For him drunk they could not bear
